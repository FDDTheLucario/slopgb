//! SameBoy `GB_STAT_update` rising-edge STAT-interrupt line — the validated,
//! inert foundation for the STAT IRQ reclock.
//!
//! **Committed but not yet wired into the live PPU.** Today the STAT IRQ is
//! raised by the gambatte-derived per-source event engine
//! (`ppu/stat_irq.rs::stat_events_tick`), a set of mode/LYC *pulse* predicates.
//! SameBoy instead keeps a single **level** — `stat_interrupt_line` = the OR of
//! the one mode source selected by [`mode_for_interrupt`](crate::ppu) and the
//! LYC source — and fires `IF |= STAT` only on its **0→1 rising edge**
//! (`display.c:523-560`). That is the classic STAT-blocking model: while the
//! line is already high from one source, a second source going high produces
//! no new interrupt.
//!
//! This module is the executable, unit-tested encoding of that rising-edge
//! core. It is a pure function of the *decoupled* interrupt mode (the
//! [`Ppu::mode_for_interrupt`](crate::ppu) field) plus the STAT register's
//! enable bits and the LYC match — exactly the inputs SameBoy reads — so the
//! swap is "drive this from the decoupled mode each dot and OR its return
//! into IF" rather than a from-scratch rewrite. It stays inert here, validated
//! against `display.c`'s worked behaviour, until that stage lands together
//! with the leading-edge read and the cc-exact boundary (the atomic reclock).
